            <h4><a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1638901/?ref_=tt_urv"> "Dark Commentary on 80's Wall Street Culture" </a></h4>
            <p>"...possibly Bale's best, or at least the one that pushed him into the spotlight. He steals the show." - <b>gavin6942</b> </p>

            <h4><b><a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0534736/?ref_=tt_urv">"A film that teeters between Miracles and Mania" </a></b></h4>
            <p>"...brilliantly directed, and a superbly acted examination of excess, and boredom, and evil. An examination, satire, critique of a time, and type of thinking." - <b>grendel-37</b></p>

            <h4><b><a href="https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7355371/?ref_=tt_urv">"A movie ahead of its time, with a meaningful and really deep message, that applies very well to modern society."</a></b></h4>
            <p>"I wish more commercial movies would push boundaries in this way nowadays and be shocking." - <b>fciocca</b></p>
      
        <h3><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_psycho/reviews?intcmp=rt-scorecard_tomatometer-reviews">Rotten Tomatoes Top Critic's Reviews:</a></h3>

            <h4>"... A ferociously intelligent, horribly violent and darkly funny parable of greed and violence." - <b>Wendy Ide</b></h4>

            <h4>"The slick satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classism with homicide, but you may laugh so loud at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him." - <b>Lisa Alspector</b></h4>

            <h4>"It needs to be seen and appreciated, like a serpent in a glass cage." - <b>Richard Corliss</b></h4>
